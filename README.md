This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How I went about it

The Dashboard Overview does not have Dynamic Data.
The School Management route has Dynamic data put in tables and the whole app is responsive.

## Tech stack used

I used Next Js for this project. For styling I used [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)

I used [Redux Toolkit query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) to make the API calls.

## Deploy on Vercel

I deployed the project on vercel on this link https://zeraki-nine.vercel.app/
