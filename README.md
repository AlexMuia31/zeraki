This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How I went about it

The Dashboard Overview does not have Dynamic Data.
The School Management route has Dynamic data put in tables and the whole app is responsive.
The tables are scrollable. You can scroll left to right and bak on mobile

## Tech stack used

I used Next Js for this project. For styling I used [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)

I used [Redux Toolkit query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) to make the API calls.

## Deploy on Vercel

I deployed the project on vercel on this link https://zeraki-nine.vercel.app/
